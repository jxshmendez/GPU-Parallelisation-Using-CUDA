# GPU-Parallelisation-Using-CUDA

# GPU-Accelerated Word Occurrence Detection

This project demonstrates GPU acceleration for a word search algorithm, comparing Serial CPU, Unoptimised GPU, and Optimised GPU implementations. Using CUDA, the algorithm checks large text datasets for specific words, leveraging GPU parallelism for performance improvement.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler with CUDA support
- NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX 2080)
- CUDA Toolkit
